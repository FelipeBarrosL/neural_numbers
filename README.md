## ANN for image classification

This notebook presents a complete lifecycle of ANN neural network for image classification with Pytorch

------
The chosen dataset is called MNIST  
This dataset includes 28x28 black and white images, each with a free hand written numbers from 0 to 9  
The train dataset has 60000 images and for test dataset we have 10000 images  
The dataset select can be downloaded at Pytorch dataset
